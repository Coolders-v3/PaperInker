## Concept
***

Paperinker is an app whose purpose is to connect different artists in order to work together. 
More specifically, Paperinker wants to give illustrators and writers the opportunity to show their work and portfolios in order to offer an easy way for them to see each other's work and projects and get in touch to work together. 
That's why it is called Paperinker, because both, illustrators and writers use paper and ink. 
The system that is used is a "like" method, which allows the user to "like" another user, so when both users happen to like each other, the result will be a match, sending both users an email to let them know that they connected.  

## Run Tests
php artisan test

## Design
***
First, was made a Sketch with Balsamic and before a design with Figma. It is also responsive. For the web application web we used SASS and Laravel's Blade and Livewire components. On the home page there is a slider with favorite jobs.
